If this project is executed there are a couple guidelines to follow. Firstly, this is part of the dissertation project so if you are reading this I assume you are a marker. 
As of the date of submission, each time the simulation is run the previous stored simulations are removed from the CSV files. This is because 
a) they take up a lot of space 
b) Up until recently this project was constantly being editied and so older results soon became irrelevant and were skewing results
Therefore, each simulation run should run with a minimum of 200-500 initial simulations to cover most possible strategy permutations, in addition to providing a good average optimal strategy.
Moreover, the final simulations can vary depending on the users preferance, from testing most trends are realised after a few thousand final simulations. In the results the project used 25,000, which would probably be the recommended amount. However this may take time to compute depending on the computer. 
In summary, run the simulations with thousands of permutations for both initial and final to avoid any issues.
